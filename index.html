<p>When I say "I love you " I mean it from the bottom of my heart. These three words carry a powerful feeling that makes my heart smile. They are not just words; they show how much someone means to me and how deeply I care. Every time I say it I feel a warm glow inside knowing that love can connect people in wonderful ways. Love makes life brighter and I cherish every moment of sharing that feeling with others.</p>
